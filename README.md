# fe-task-account-users
Front-end application for listing users

## Notes on UI solution
Missing from the design:
- Different button states (hover,active). Some states were added. Focus would be good to add for accessibility.
- The UserRow name when selected had 2 different colors in the Figma: #2D3748 and #1A202C. The colors are similar enough, so it is not clear if that was on purpose.
- The color names in the theme do not have a great system right now. The names would usually come from the designers' color schema.
