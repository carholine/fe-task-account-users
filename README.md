# fe-task-account-users
Front-end application for listing users

## Notes on UI solution
The design did not have specifics on the different states of buttons and checkboxes, so added those myself (hover, active state for example). Ideally this should be synced with the designers. It would also be good to add focus states for better accessibility.
